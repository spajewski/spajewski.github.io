This is Susan Pajewski's blog website. Github is the perfect place for it because:
- the blog is currently quite small
- github takes care of version control - very nice :)
- all the management is online and secure

Usage notes:
- the url of the website is created by github as USERNAME.github.io, where USERNAME is spajewski
- the domain susanpajewski.com has been set up to point to this url
- this blog uses CNAME to display the domain url

- github requires that the website code *must* reside in github folder main/USERNAME
- an easy way to disable this site is to rename the website folder main/USERNAME
